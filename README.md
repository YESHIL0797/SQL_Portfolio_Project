This repository contains SQL queries that work on two CSV files: one containing information about deaths caused by COVID-19 worldwide, and the other providing information about COVID-19 vaccinations. The queries are written to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) by importing the CSV files into a local MySQL Workbench server. The repository can be used as a reference for anyone looking to perform similar analysis on COVID-19 data.

The queries in this repository have been tested and confirmed to work with MySQL Workbench, but may need to be modified for use with other SQL clients. The queries are provided as-is and should be used at your own risk.

The CSV files used in these queries can be obtained from various open data sources. The death and vaccination data are collected from the respective official sources, and the user is responsible for obtaining and using the data in compliance with any applicable terms of use or license agreements.

Please note that the data used in these queries may not be the most recent, and that the analysis performed is not intended to be used for decision making or medical advice.

Please feel free to use these queries as a starting point for your own analysis and let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
